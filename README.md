# A Function for Retrieving Rainfall Data from Weather Radar
## Nathaniel Parker, KSU Dept. of Agronomy, Manhattan, KS


## Motivation
Rainfall is the main source of water for plants, animals and humans and doubles as the input variable in the soil water balance. Accurate rainfall measurement is important for monitoring environmental events such as drought and flooding. Rainfall measurement is typically done using a rain gauge, which only gives a point measurement. In recent times, there is increased interest in rainfall measurement on a large spatial scale and thus radar data has become very useful in undertaking this purpose. Although many weather-monitoring agencies such as the National Weather Service make their data freely available for download through their websites, the process is often complicated and the data usually contain missing values. There is therefore a need to create a function which will simplify the data retrieval process and provide a data with replaced missing values which is ready for use.

## Objective 
Create a python function to retrieve hourly rainfall data with replaced missing values from the NOAA National Weather Serviceâ€™s radar in Kansas

## Outcome 
I want to create a .csv file with hourly radar-derived rainfall data for a particular location in Kansas.
