    "# A code for retrieving rainfall measurement at any given location from Gridded rainfall products\n",
    "##### The objective of this project is to retrieve rainfall reading at any given location from gridded rainfall products using the latitude and longitude of that location. The code computes the distances between the location of interest (LOI) and the map coordinates, and then select the rainfall of the closest location to LOI as the rainfall at LOI. The gridded product can be in either hourly, daily, monthly, or yearly time intervals. \n",
    "##### A single rainfall map (in GeoTiff format) for the last 365 days (before April 26, 2020) for contiguous USA from the National Weather Service's (NWS) multi-sensor gridded rainfall product, which was downloaded via https://water.weather.gov/precip/download.php was used as an example data file to set up this code. However, the code should be compatible with any GeoTiff file from any other source. In addition, the code can be easily modified to process multiple maps (i.e. stacked maps). "
